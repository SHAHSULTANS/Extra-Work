    <h1>Example text alignment justify.</h1>
    <p>The text-align: justify; value
        streaches the lines so that each 
        line has equal width( like in newspaper and 
        magazines).

    <div>In my younger  and more valnerable years my father
        gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind
        ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 
        'just remember  that all the perople in this world haven't had advantages that
        you've had.'
